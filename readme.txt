The Odin Project Foundations path PROJECT: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

Planning:
Understand the Problem
How do you play rock paper scissors against the computer in a browser console?
Plan
Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
It will be on the console, so simple text interaction (to begin with)
What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
User needs to input from a choice of rock, scissors or paper
Need to generate rock, scissors or paper for a computer opponent
What’s the desired output?
An alert letting the user know they won or lost
Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
Console > Run the program (call its function) > User is asked to choose between rock paper or scissors.
User may enter any case of those three words (case insensitive).
Other entries are rejected. Question is asked again until the user enters as instructed.  
Program randomizes the computer and user’s choices. > Program declares a winner, or tie. In case of a tie, the user must play again.  
Divide and Conquer (Implementation)
Need a variable to catch the user input.
Need a variable to store the computer’s generated input.
Need to prompt the user for their input.
Need to store the user input.
Need to generate and store the computer input.
Need to compare the user input to the computer input. 
Need to decide a winner, loser or a tie situation.
If there is a tie, need to resolve the tie situation.
Need to display the outcome to the user.
